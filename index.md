### Introduction

My name is Jesse Troutt. I am an alumni at Southern New Hampshire University as an Honor Roll student.
I am majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering.

This is my portfolio where I have included:
 - A professional self-assessment detailing my work throughout my studies and the enhancements made to my chosen artifacts
 - A code review of my artifacts chosen along with enhancements
 - My Exceptions artifact which covers Software Design and Engineering along with Algorithms and Data Structures
 - My PMTool artifact which is a personal project enhanced to include Databases

Each artifact is chosen to meet the specific criteria of the CS-499 Computer Science Capstone course where I enhance the artifacts to show my skills as a Software Engineer.

This is my code review for both artifacts across all categories.
The video covers an overview of what each artifact is meant to accomplish, as well as going through a checklist of review items pertaining to the code.

### Software Design and Engineering: Exceptions

This artifact is called Exceptions. It is intended to showcase the handling of exceptions created by purposely causing overflows, errors, and other exceptions and then handling those exceptions without compromising security and integrity. It was created for class CS-405 in April of 2022.

I specifically chose this artifact as I believe that software security is extremely important and the handling of exceptions is a crucial key to keeping a program secure. This artifact shows that I am capable of comprehending code exceptions and have the ability to write handlers to catch these exceptions in a clean, organized manner. Each function has its own purpose for creating an exception, handling an exception, or performing an algorithm. These functions are also organized in a way that is simple to understand with appropriate comments. I was able to update code comments to be more helpful in understanding functions, I used my standing knowledge of the C++ language to include both limits and a standard namespace. The inclusion of limits allowed me to eliminate possible human error by replacing a variable with a constant. This will also be useful in any future adaptations of this project. The inclusion of the standard namespace allowed me to eliminate unnecessary repetition by removing “std::” from all cout’s, endl’s and the like. I was also able to enhance the error messages produced to give a more helpful reason for the program to exit, as well as include a visible error message that was previously not output during the overflow checking section. 

With the enhancements to this artifact I was able to meet a few of the targeted outcomes. Due to comment changes and error codes I was able to employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making. Along with the changes to limits and namespaces I showed a development of a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources. 

I ran into a few challenges when enhancing my project. The first was that after coming back to it after so long, I noticed that I was struggling to remember how it was meant to work. The comments I had originally left were not very helpful, and it seemed that running the program would just exit without any specific reason why. In updating the artifact I changed a few error codes and included an output for one of the errors and I found that it was exiting due to finding an exception. Since the update it is much more clear what is happening while running the program.
