### Introduction

My name is Jesse Troutt. I am an alumni at Southern New Hampshire University as an Honor Roll student.
I am majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering.

This is my portfolio where I have included:
 - A professional self-assessment detailing my work throughout my studies and the enhancements made to my chosen artifacts
 - A code review of my artifacts chosen along with enhancements
 - My Exceptions artifact which covers Software Design and Engineering along with Algorithms and Data Structures
 - My PMTool artifact which is a personal project enhanced to include Databases

Each artifact is chosen to meet the specific criteria of the CS-499 Computer Science Capstone course where I enhance the artifacts to show my skills as a Software Engineer.

### Code Review

[Code Review Video](https://youtu.be/udnlpyADtt4)

This is my code review for both artifacts across all categories.
The video covers an overview of what each artifact is meant to accomplish, as well as going through a checklist of review items pertaining to the code.
